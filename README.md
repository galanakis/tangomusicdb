# Tango music database

The objective of this project is to compile a database of tango music,
mostly for offline use.

## Motivation

Even though there are online databases, they require constant (and slow)
internet connection. Some of them are only accessible with a fee.
An offline database which is sufficiently complete
can allow for the development of tango-dj utilities (mp3 tagging, auto-tanda).

## State

This is at an early stage.

## Objectives

0) Creation of an offline database
1) Local web interface
2) mp3 tagger with fuzzy matching
3) Automatic tanda generator

## Copyright

This project does not contain any actual music files or any
copyrighted material. It is built using publically accessible information.
